# GAN-Trail
My first trial with a Generative Adversarial Network
Here, I have coded across 3 specific sections.
1. I have coded the Discriminator Network 
2. I have coded the generator model
3. Finally, I have combined both and provided a model for local image patches of size 64x64. 
The real-image accuracy was maintained at 62% on average. 
There were a lot of variations on training the first few times, so will have to explore more stable GAN models.
